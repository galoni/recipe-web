# ChefStream Documentation Hub
 
 This directory (`docs/`) is the **living source of truth** for how we work, build, and operate ChefStream. 
 
 It is NOT a static archive. Every major feature implementation should result in updates here to reflect:
 1.  New architectural decisions (ADRs)
 2.  Improved processes
 3.  Updated setup instructions
 
 ## Structure
 
 *   **`/architecture`**: High-level design, data flow diagrams, and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
 *   **`/processes`**: The "How-To" guides for our SDLC (Testing, Deployment, Security Reviews).
 *   **`/setup`**: Onboarding guides and environment configuration (Docker).
 
 ## Contributing
 
 If you find a gap in documentation while working on a task, **fix it immediately**. Documentation debt is technical debt.
