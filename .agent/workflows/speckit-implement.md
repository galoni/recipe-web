description: Execute the implementation tasks
---

1. Read `specs/$SPECIFY_FEATURE/tasks.md`.
2. **Iterate through tasks** sequentially:
   - Identify the next unchecked task `[ ]`.
   - Read the implementation plan and spec for context.
   - **Execute** the task (create file, write code, run test).
   - **Verify** the task (run test, check build).
   - Mark task as complete `[x]`.
   - **Commit** (checking `constitution.md` rules like tests and docs).
3. If blocked, Notify User.
4. When all tasks are done, create a `walkthrough.md`.
